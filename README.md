Great! It looks like the installation was successful. The yt-dlp package and its dependencies have been installed in the virtual environment. Now you have a few options to proceed:

You can use yt-dlp directly by running:
Copy/home/ubuntu/yt-dlp-wrapper.sh [options] [URL]

For convenience, you can add an alias to your .bashrc file as suggested. You can do this by running:
echo "alias yt-dlp='/home/ubuntu/yt-dlp-wrapper.sh'" >> /home/ubuntu/.bashrc

After adding this alias, you'll need to either restart your terminal or run

source ~/.bashrc

for the changes to take effect. Then you can use yt-dlp as a command directly.

If you want to use the download script we created earlier, make sure you've saved it as download_music.sh and made it executable with chmod +x download_music.sh.

Now, to use the download script:

Create a text file (e.g., links.txt) with your YouTube and SoundCloud links, one per line.
Run the script with:

./download_music.sh links.txt

This should process each link in the file and download the audio to the specified music directory (by default, $HOME/Music/Downloads).
If you encounter any issues or need to make any modifications, please let me know. Also, remember to respect copyright laws and terms of service when downloading content.
